# Deployment
In the terminal, navigate to the location in which you would like to store the repo. You can do so by typing the following command:

cd yourDirectoryHere

Now, with the repo URL still copied to your clipboard, itâ€™s time to clone the repo. Enter the following command:

git clone https://github.com/zippote/JavaSeleniumTestngFramework.git

Give the process a few moments to complete.

As a matter of good practice, check to make sure that the repository is on your machine. To do so, navigate to the directory in which it was stored.

Create a new local branch by doing:

git checkout -b yourBranchName

Work away...
